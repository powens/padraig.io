# Fools Errand recap, from a guy who went 1-4

First major for this club, and it kind of shows. The TOs were a bit inconsistent with their rulings, and their player placed terrain system was weird. Each table had a mandatory terrain piece that had to be placed in the center of the board. Some tables it was just a small forrest. On other tables, it was a massive 12"x12" based ruin. Often the center piece wasn't symmetric, giving an advantage to one opponent. Not only that, the sets of ruins for each player on tables were not equal.

This lead to some real feels bad moments for me. I'm not sure if I'd ever make the trek back out to another major hosted at this club because of it.

## Round 1: GT11 vs Light Harlequins

I was hoping to dodge them the whole tournament, but might as well start with the pain. This was my first run at the new Harlequins' codex, and the volume of rules and buffs that I had to keep track of my opponent's kind of broke my brain. In spite of that, I kept it a close game. In turn 2, I pushed my Devilfish filled with breachers forward to try and get some more shots down range, and to try and pop his boat with the HQs inside. That was a mistake. At the bottom of round 2, my opponent opted to concede the game, assuming the score would stay as it presently was. After checking with the judges, I confirmed that it would be a 70-0 loss for him, and convinced him to keep playing. His kroot tagged Voidweavers shot themselves out of combat and absolutely all 3 of my TTL targets, while his Solitaire with the no rerolls defensive buffs and a 3++ tanked 2 turns of commander shooting, unfortunately I forgot (or didn't have enough cp) to turn off the invulns here.

Final score 60-64 loss. It was close, and there were several small misplays that would have turned the game into a win or tie for me. Not a bad showing for my first game

**Mistakes:**

- Pushing my Breachers forward to deny an objective. Should have kept them back as an obsec pinata. I may have been able to charge the Devilfish into the Voidweavers
- Not targeting the Voidweavers with my SMS earlier. It would have been hard to do just because of the -6" range though
- Deploying my stealth suits behind obscuring, or just using a CP to reserve them. Lost 4 points on RND

## Round 2: GT13 vs 2 Volkite, 3 PBC, Tallyman Death Guard

The surface area of obscuring ruins was high on this table. My objective was to shoot my opponent off objectives to deny the sticky objectives, and try to survive. His 2 volkite contempors and 3 PBCs shot my Stormsurge with impunity, dealing 12 damage in the first round alone. Knowing that my stormsurge wouldn't survive another round of shooting, I moved the stormsurge far back into my corner, sure enough it exploded. Luckily the explosion range was too small to hit any of my units.

On Round 4, I tried to send my AFPs into my opponent's Plague marines holding his back objective, and performing the Data Intercept action. My vespid would have taken the objective. Denying 7+ points. The unit had 1 plague marine left. Oh well.

Final score: 74-73 win. Closer than it should have been.

**Mistakes:**

- Not scoring Decisive Action first turn because I forgot I had it
- Could have made a better effort to outrange psychic interrogation? But that would have made it harder to play the mission

## Round 3: GT33 vs GSC

Let's just get it out of the way. I got screwed by the obscuring center piece on this mission/table. My opponent parked a truck on the center objective out of line of sight, and could hold the ruin with little impunity. I played too passively as well, as well as failing 2 CP rerolled 3+ advance rolls to get more models on the center objective for strangle. I lost out on primary on this mission fairly hard.

Final score: 70-80 loss.

**Mistakes:**

- Moving my home objective farther away from the center, rather than making my side objective safer
- Playing too passively trying to screen out GSC deep strike shenanigans
- Not pressing harder on my opponent's claim that he could tag the center objective on the outside of the ruin. The truck was out of range.
- Missed out on 2 strangles because my center ruin was too far away from the center objective, and
- Missed out on 1 RND as I over committed my stealth suits to clear out 20 GSC goobers and an HQ

## Round 4: GT?? vs railgun spam FSE

This list somewhere between soft to hard counters mine. I needed to win the indirect war to win the game. We got a table with a sparse set of ruins, which made it even more challenging. The center ruin was a 12"x12" two-piece ruin (barf). I spent the 2cp to reserve my stormsurge, and I won the roll off to go first, screened out his homing beacon crisis suit drop, and destroyed one hammerhead. Unfortunately, the center ruin I Strike and Faded my crisis suit unit behind was classified by the TO as two pieces, when I was operating under the assumption that it was one. My crisis suit team was in direct line of fire of 1 hammerhead, and 7 broadsides. They were obliterated. I did my best effort to recover the game, but it never quite got back to me. Not getting a good night's sleep Saturday night could really be felt here.

Final score: 47-75 loss.

**Mistakes:**

- Playing on this god-awful board
- Clarifying with the TO how this ruin should play

## Round 5: GT?? vs Black Templars

Played a bit too passive on this one. The BT army wasn't fast, and didn't have a lot of shooting. I went aggro a turn too late. Got hit with an awful set of dice rolls on turn 2 (rolling 12 shots on 9d6 blast), which allowed 2.5 infiltrators to sit on an objective, giving my opponent 12 point primary, and denying my strangle. I also failed to kill a lone biker off a second objective in the same turn. I can't remember how I allocated my indirect fire that turn, but it was kind of rough. It set off a turn of reactions that caused me to sacrifice my breachers and devilfish a turn earlier than I really wanted.
