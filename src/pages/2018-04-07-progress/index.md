Progress is coming a bit slowly for this blog. I've decided to handroll my own theme and custom CSS this time around. As I had already known; I'm not good at design.

I'm doing a work in-house talk on CSS Grid in the next few months. I decided to use CSS Grid as the subject as it is a relatively basic topic, and a technology that we aren't leveraging right now. I'm planning on building the slides with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) - the plan being that I can showcase the features of CSS Grid straight from my slide deck. I'm unsure if I can post the slides just yet.
